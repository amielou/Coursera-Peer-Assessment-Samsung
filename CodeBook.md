##Code Definition and Data Definition for SmartPhoneDatabyActivitySubject.csv

###Code definitions

The coding standards followed through the R script were Pascal Case (sometimes referred to as upper Camel Case).  The standard also used by Microsoft developers.  I believe this to be the most readable form and, as long as variable naming is consistent, it should meet the requirement of readability.



The CSV file has 180 columns corresponding to 30 subjects participating in 6 separate activities.

	* LAYING.#
		# represents the subject and Laying represent the activity Laying
	
	* SITTING.#
		# represents the subject and sitting represent the activity sitting

	* STANDING.#
		# represents the subject and Standing represent the activity standing

	* WALKING.#
		# represents the subject and Walking represent the activity walking

	* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS.#
		# represents the subject and Walking_Downstairs represent the activity walking downstairs
	
	* WALKING_UPSTAIRS.#
		# represents the subject and Walking_Upstairs represent the activity walking upstairs
	


The 79 rows in the csv containt the subject's overall average for each of the 79 measures from the original tidy data set:
